    <h1>The Missing Advice I Needed When Starting My Career</h1>
    <p>I have been working on the web for over 22 years now, and I feel like I wasted so many of those years. If only I could go back and share a few hard truths with myself at the start of my career. Unfortunately, I cannot, but I can share that advice with you.
  Admittedly, you are almost certainly not as idiotic as I was. But hopefully, there will be something in this advice that inspires you.
  Speaking of inspiration, that leads me nicely into my first piece of wisdom!</p>
    <h2>Look Beyond The Web For Inspiration</h2>
    <p>I used to be a dedicated follower of fashion who wasted so much time looking at other “cool” websites and browsing galleries of inspirational websites. My design style would morph to embrace the latest trends, from Web 2.0 to hero banners.</p>
    <p>The result of this was bland “me too” design. But worst of all, it never put the user first. It was all about making something look good in my portfolio.</p>

    </figure>
    <p>It was such a waste because so much inspiration is all around us: great books on classic print design, architectural trends, even airport signage (a personal obsession of mine).</p>
    <p>Don’t make my mistakes. You don’t even have the luxury of my excuses. With <a href="">CSS grid</a>, the possibilities are endless, and we should all embrace them.</p>
    <p>On the subject of latest trends, that brings me to my next transgression: obsessing over tools.</p>
    <h2>Stop Obsessing Over Tools</h2>
    <p>We’ve wasted hours arguing over what tool is best. Should we code in PHP or classic ASP? (Yes, I am that old.) Can I be a “proper” web designer and code in Dreamweaver? Which content management systems should we use? The list went on.</p>
    <p>Some tool or other would become trendy for whatever reason, and we would all jump on the bandwagon, until the next one emerged, and we jumped to that after an even more furious debate.</p>
    <p>I see the same today: arguments over <a href="#">frameworks</a> and whether we should embrace Angular or React. <strong>I don’t follow these discussions anymore</strong> because somewhere along the line I realized something: There is no single answer.</p>

      <figcaption>Do not become overly attached to a single tool. Tools come and go, and no one will be appropriate for every project. (<a href="">View large version</a>)</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>A lot of these choices come down to personal preference or the requirements of the individual client. <strong>Remain flexible and open to change.</strong> If you don’t, you’ll go the way of Flash developers.</p>
    <p>All of that time I wasted arguing about tools would have been so much better spent elsewhere, like on improving my soft skills.</p>
    <h2>Get Better At Working With Others</h2>
    <p>I was an insufferable know-it-all when I was young. I always had the answers and always knew a better way to do something. I am sure you are not like that, although, let’s be honest, how would you know if you were? I certainly had no idea how irritating I was, despite the warning signs.</p>
    <p>For a start, I found myself <strong>constantly arguing with everybody</strong>. Everything seemed like a battle because nobody around me “got it.” In hindsight, that was because I was too busy irritating everybody to take the time to explain things properly. But at the time, it just felt like everybody else was stupid.</p>
    <p>I wish I had realized how weak I was in this area. Perhaps then I would have invested time and energy in improving how I worked alongside other people. Maybe I would have listened more and put the same effort into understanding my colleagues as I did my users.</p>
    <p>I am not suggesting I should have done this necessarily to be a good man (trust me, I am not now). Instead, I should have done this because it would have made my life so much easier. <strong>I wasted endless time arguing and alienating people</strong>, people I needed on my side to do my job. It was <em className='t-light'>incredibly frustrating</em>.</p>

    <p>If I had developed that skill of working with people earlier, it would have also allowed me to push beyond the confines of my role.</p>
